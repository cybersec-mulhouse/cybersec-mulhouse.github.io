        <p>We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all participants, organizers,
          and other members of the community (collectively known as Users) of the Mulhouse Capture The Flag ("CTF")
          Competition, and its presence on the corresponding Discord Channel free from discrimination for any reason
          including on the basis of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, race, ethnicity, age and
          religion. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for User behavior as well as the steps to reporting
          and consequences for unacceptable behavior.</p>
          <br/>
        <u> Behavior</u>
        <p>
          All Users are expected to:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
          <li>Be considerate, respectful, and collaborative.</li>
          <li>Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory or harassing behavior or speech.</li>
          <li>Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow Users â€“ your fellow Users may have a different level of
            comfort with respect to language and personal space.</li>
          <li>Alert Mulhouse CTF organizers (see Reporting Guide below) if you notice any unacceptable behavior.</li>
          <li>This code is not exhaustive or complete. It serves to distill our common understanding of a collaborative,
            shared environment, and goals. We expect it to be followed in spirit as much as in the letter.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <u>Unacceptable Behavior</u>
        <p>
          Unacceptable behaviors include:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
          <li>Intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory, or demeaning conduct.</li>
          <li>Offensive verbal comments including as related to gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability,
            race, ethnicity, age, or religion.</li>
          <li>Inappropriate use of nudity and/or sexual images in public and online spaces (including but not limited to
            public channels, private groups, and direct messages in the Discord Channel).</li>

        </ul>
        <br/>
        Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
        Unacceptable behavior by Users will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to
        comply immediately. If a User engages in unacceptable behavior, the Mulhouse CTF organizers may take any action
        they deem appropriate at their sole discretion, up to and including expulsion from the Competition and expulsion
        from the Discord.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <u>Reporting Guide</u>
        <p>If you are being subjected to unacceptable behavior on this platform (i.e. the Competition or the Discord
          Channel), notice that someone else is being subjected to unacceptable behavior, or have concerns that this
          Code of Conduct is not being followed, notify a Mulhouse CTF Organizer as soon as possible, either by
          contacting them in the Discord, or by emailing .

          In your report, please include:
          <br/>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-10">
          <li>Your contact information.</li>
          <li>Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. </li>
          <li>If there are additional witnesses, please include them as well.</li>
          <li>Your account of what occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. </li>
          <li>If there is a publicly available record please include a link.</li>
          <li>Any additional information that may be helpful.</li>
          </ul>
          <br/>
          After filing a report, a Mulhouse CTF Organizer will contact you personally. The Mulhouse CTF Organizers will
          then review the incident, follow up with any additional questions, and make a decision as to how to respond.
          <br/>
          All reports will remain as confidential as possible. The Mulhouse CTF Organizers will determine and carry out
          the appropriate course of action, and will be available to help Users experiencing unacceptable behavior feel
          safe for the duration of the Competition.
